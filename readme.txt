Note:
- I have chosen to comment out the fork implementation in the entry method, getCoinChangeCombination_test.
- The implementation of runFunctionProcessMethod_Create is based on and catered towards this fact.
- The final answer can be seen by simply invoking printTreeForDebugging() method which has already been done in the entry method, getCoinChangeCombination_test.
